### Thoughts on Data

1. School spending per student did not elicit a connection between higher scores and better student performance.  In fact the data leads me to believe the more a school spends per student the worse the school does.  There could be a lot of reasons for this:  Maybe a federal grant was issued to help underperforming schools? Is the district teacher's union creating bloated schools and lazier staff? We might be missing a part of the picture here. 
2. Perhaps there are some structural issues here as there are significant differences in student performance between charter and district.  Even the largest charter, Wilson High, vastly outperforms district schools in the same size bracket. Size was also a good indicator of performance as the largest schools tended to have much lower overall passing rates.
