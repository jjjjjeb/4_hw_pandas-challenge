### Thoughts on Data

1. The school spending per student table did not elicit a connection between spending and better student performance.  In fact the data leads one to believe that the more a school spends per student the worse the school does...  There could be a lot of reasons for this:  Maybe a federal grant was issued to help underperforming schools? Or is the district teacher's union creating bloated schools and lazier staff? We might be missing a part of the picture here. 
2. Perhaps there are some structural issues as there are significant differences in student performance between charter and district.  Even the largest charter, Wilson High, vastly outperforms district schools in the same size bracket. Size was also a good indicator of performance as the largest schools tended to have much lower overall passing rates.
