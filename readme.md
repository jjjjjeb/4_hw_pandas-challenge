# PyCitySchools

This repo displays analysis and visualization of a school district data set. I utlizes pandas to discover information on school performance and budget within jupyter notebook. View the [notebook](./PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb)

## Some Findings
* School spending per student did not elicit a connection between spending and better student performance.  
* There are significant differences in student performance between charter and district.  Even the largest charter, Wilson High, vastly outperforms district schools in the same size bracket. 
* Size was a good indicator of performance as the largest schools tended to have much lower overall passing rates.
